# project2-prog1
In this project i implemented a simple web spreadsheet application using python. I mainly worked on the files "spreadsheet.py" which contains functions for manipulating a simple spreadsheet data structure, and "interface.py" which implements the graphical interface of the spreadsheet application.
To run the program you simply need to run "__main__.py" in the spreadsheet folder.
I learned from this project to write more complex programs and how to break down big problems into small, more manageable chunks. Also, i learned to write more efficient code by replacing loops by functions such as map, filter, and reduce.
